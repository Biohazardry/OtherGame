Bendzz's TF Game

The player is cursed with 'sexy irony'. Suddenly the formerly mundane world is full of pitfalls that will TF you. Going to the strip club? Get ready to wind up a dancer. Drinking some milk? Uh oh, catgirls like milk 0_o

Meant to be sort of an open world RPG, but instead of building up a character over time, you fall victim to many different endings soon into each playthrough- Sort of like The Stanley Parable.

Built in Unreal Engine 4. Internet Multiplayer and Oculus Rift enabled.
